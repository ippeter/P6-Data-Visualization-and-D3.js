  	  	<b>Data Story</b><br><br>
  	  	<font size="2">
  	  	Looking at the all years stats, one can see that the overwhelming number of players studied in California colleges. Next up Texas and Florida, but way far from California! Reasons for that could be several: good climate might be the obvious and the most important as baseball is the outdoor game. Climate could allow practicing the whole year through. Thus, colleges at CA, TX and FL could make use of it and offer better options for future baseball prospects.<br>

On the other hand, some states never hosted any future professional baseball players, such as Alaska and Montana. Some states, such as North Dakota and South Dakota, only hosted a few players, 3 and 5 respectively. The climate conditions might be an explanation here as well.<br>

If one drills down to the year-by-year stats, one will see that first students that would go pro, showed up in Eastern states, such as New York, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, in 1860s and 1870s. However, at that times, the number of students was quite low, about only 1 student per state.<br>

In 1880s future players started to spread into more states: 8 states hosted future players in 1890, 14 states in 1895, 20+ states in 1900 and so forth. It could be explained by a growing popularity of education and a growing number of colleges.<br>

In the middle of 20th century California became a clear leader.<br>

One may also notice that data are some what strange after 2010: there are too few students who later became MLB players. For example, there is only 1 (one) such student in 2014. It could be explained by the fact that potential players were still studying and didn't go pro just yet.<br>

To summarize, one can see that young players showed up studing in colleges in Eastern states, but eventually most of them moved to Southern states. The leading states are CA, TX and FL. The popularity of baseball greatly increased among college students in 20th Century. More students went pro after college.<br>
